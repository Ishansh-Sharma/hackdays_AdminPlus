So the basic idea is this - an AI-driven web portal that opens with a conversational chatbot. The bot understands natural-language queries, maps them to the right department and document, presents a validated digital form (or lets you upload/scan a hardcopy), auto-validates the submission, routes it to the correct admin queue, and—if approved—auto-assigns a time slot based on admin availability and notifies the student. If rejected, the system returns precise correction instructions so students can fix and resubmit online. The result: far fewer visits, faster approvals, transparent tracking, and an auditable, scalable admin workflow.
